        This will be confusing.
        minAmount refers to the minimum damage the attack can do.
        maxAmount is self-explanatory. This is optional if you want it to do a fixed amount of damage each time.
        also, you know the rolls element defined above? that's optional, if you add it then the amounts put into inflictDamage are ignored

        fixed refers to whether the damage amount is relative to the entity's max health or not
        if fixed is true, then writing "50" in minAmount will do 50 damage.
        if fixed is false, then writing "0.5" in minAmount will do 50% of the entity's max health in damage.
        if you don't add the fixed attribute at all then it's set to false by default.

        type refers to who is getting the damage.
        has several things it can be set to:
          Target - will damage the entity being targeted
          Self - will damage the entity using the move
          Target,Self - both the target and self
          All,Self - everyone on the entity's team
          All,Target - everyone on the target's team
          All - everyone

        same as inflictDamage but with less features
        amount is always relative to the entity's max health
        min and maxAmount don't exist
        if you really want those added for healing then let me know.
